What Are Epson Printer Drivers?
===============================

Printer drivers are small software programs that enable your computer to communicate with your Epson printer. Whether you're using Windows, macOS, or Linux, each OS needs the proper driver to send print commands effectively.

Without drivers:

- Print jobs may fail  
- Features like scanning or wireless printing may not work  
- You may see error messages or blank pages
